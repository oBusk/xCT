h3. Download

h4. World of Warcraft (4.3.4 live)

p. "Latest Version (2.4.1)":https://github.com/downloads/dandruff/xCT/dandruff-xCT+2.4.1(4.3.4).zip

h3. Description

p. xCT+ is a continuation and fork of "xCT":http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info18053-xCT.html (by braindump, aka Affli).  Affli is currently updating his version of xCT.  xCT+ will continue to expand upon the features that xCT has.

p. Overall, xCT+ is a replacement for Blizzard's scrolling combat text.  It is superior to the default combat text because xCT+ organizes incoming healing, incoming damage, and outgoing damage/healing into their own frames.

p. For those that have used Affli's xCT Add-On, xCT+ expands the functionality of its predecessor.  New features include:

* A new loot frame

* A new yell setting that allows you to yell interrupts, dispells, taunts, and more to your party or raid (coming soon)

* A grid when positioning the frames

* A new window that shows crits that you've done.

# A new frame prosition profile system

* And more soon to come!
